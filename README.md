Baconian [beËˆkonin] is a toolbox for model-based reinforcement learning with user-friendly experiment setting-up, logging 
and visualization modules developed by [CAP](http://cap.scse.ntu.edu.sg/). We aim to develop a flexible, re-usable and 
modularized framework that can allow the user's to easily set-up a model-based rl experiments by reuse modules we 
offered.


### Release news:
- 2019.7.30 Release the v0.2.0, updated full API documentations, added visualization module.
- 2019.6.23 Released the v0.1.5, added data pre-processing module, added support for more Gym environment (Roboschool, Atari) and deep mind control suit.

### Documentation
We support python 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7 with Ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04.
Documentation is available at http://baconian-public.readthedocs.io/
### TODO and Road Map
Currently, the project is under activate development. We are working towards a stable 1.0 version. Details of the road map 
and future plan will be released as soon as possible. 

Currently we are working on
- [ ] Simplified flow module
- [ ] Latent-space method supporting.
- [ ] General Ensemble method
