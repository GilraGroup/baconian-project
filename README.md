Baconian [beËˆkonin] is a toolbox for model-based reinforcement learning with user-friendly experiment setting-up, logging 
and visualization modules developed by [CAP](http://cap.scse.ntu.edu.sg/). We aim to develop a flexible, re-usable and 
modularized framework that can allow the user's to easily set-up a model-based rl experiments by reuse modules we 
offered.
