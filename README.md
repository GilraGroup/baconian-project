Baconian [beËˆkonin] is a toolbox for model-based reinforcement learning with user-friendly experiment setting-up, logging 
and visualization modules developed by [CAP](http://cap.scse.ntu.edu.sg/). We aim to develop a flexible, re-usable and 
modularized framework that can allow the user's to easily set-up a model-based rl experiments by reuse modules we 
offered.

### Release news:
- 2019.3.15 Release the v0.1.1, add model saving scheduler, fix some bugs and update pip installing flow.
- 2019.03.04 Release the v0.1 within CAP group.
### Documentation
Documentation is available at http://baconian.withcap.org (the documentations writing is undergoing)
#### How to install

(`source activate you_env` if you are using anaconda or consider creating a new env by `conda env create -name some_env`)
##### install as a local package (if you want to modify the code or contribute)
```
cd /path/to/baconian
pip install -e baconain 
```
##### install as a third-party package (if you want to import some modules and re-use it in your own project)
```
cd /path/to/baconian
pip install baconain 
```

Then you are free to go. If you want to use the full environments of gym, e.g., Mujoco, please refer to its  project 
page to install the requirements (you may need to re-install gym after that.)

#### Examples
There are some examples placed at `examples` which you can have a test. 


### Todo

- [ ] Visualization module
- [ ] Optimal control algorithms: LQR, Ilqr
- [ ] State-of-art model-based algorithms
- [ ] Benchmark tests on multiple tasks
