[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Lukeeeeee/ModelBasedRLFramework.svg?token=dTo6wB1jmzxu58xyRPX6&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Lukeeeeee/ModelBasedRLFramework)


#### Feature that will include:
```
1. global random seed control
2. unit test
3. error and exception handling
4. more user-friendly configuration
5. more user-friendly logging
6. paralleled pipeline
```

### some third party package/tools may be used
```
1. pytest for unit test
2. travis for CI
3. COVERALLS: for test coverage 
4. Sphinx for documentation
5. concurrent for paralleded computing?
``` 

### TODO
```
1. algorithms that will be include: 
    dqn, ddpg, trpo, ppo, mpc, acktrs, a2c, a3c
```


### Old code problem:
```
1. can't detect the configuration fault.
2. take too much time to set up the experiments, froze the whole configure instantly after running 
3. consider some parser argument of script 
4. no unit test
5. configuration is too complicated
```
