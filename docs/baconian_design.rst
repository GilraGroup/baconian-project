System Overview of Baconian
=========================================

The system overview of Baconian is shown in below figure. We design Baconian with the objective to
minimize usersâ€™ coding effort on developing and testing MBRL algorithms. With Baconian, the user can easily setup a
MBRL experiment by configuring the target algorithms and modules without the need for understanding the inner
mechanisms.

    System Overview of Baconian.


Baconian follows the Object-Oriented Design (OOD) and applies design patterns including strategy method, observer
method, singleton method, and decorator method to build a flexible and reusable framework. The simplified system
implementation diagram is shown in below figure.
